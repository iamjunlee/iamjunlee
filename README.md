## Hi there 👋 I'm Jun

I'm a software developer building **Loqu**, a social language exchange app powered by AI and real human connections.  
I care about building scalable, maintainable, and debug-friendly systems that stay efficient as they grow.

### 🛠️ What I’m building
- 🗣️ **Loqu** — a multilingual language exchange platform where users practice speaking and writing with each other, powered by AI correction and push-based habit loops
- 💡 Built with:
  - **Expo + React ** for true cross-platform support
  - **AWS Amplify** for a fully serverless backend
  - **S3 + AWS Lambda image processing** for optimized media delivery
  - **Firebase & RevenueCat** for analytics and subscription management
  - **i18n & multi-region support** for a truly global audience

### 📈 What I've done so far
- 🧪 Built a custom A/B testing system to measure user behavior and retention
- 🌍 Implemented real-time push notification infrastructure with localization in 10+ languages
- 📦 Shipped an automated image optimization pipeline using AWS Lambda
- 💬 Designed and deployed scalable chat & thread-based feed features using AWS GraphQL
- 💸 Launched with subscription model and full App Store / Play Store compliance

### 💬 Ask me about
- Building for scale with serverless (AWS amplify)
- Multilingual app design and localization strategies
- Mobile + Web code sharing using Expo + React

### 🚀 Fun fact
Before Loqu, I bootstrapped and scaled a profitable private gym business—turning underused resources into predictable revenue. I love spotting inefficiencies in systems and turning them into opportunities.
